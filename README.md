# NASA Full-Stack Project

## Description
This is a full-stack project developed for scheduling a mission launch for interstellar travel to one of the Kepler Exoplanets. The project combines a front-end application built with React and Arwes UI framework, and a back-end API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The front-end and back-end components work together to provide a complete solution for managing and monitoring mission launches.

## Installation
To install the project dependencies, you can run the following commands:



>npm run install-server
npm run install-client

Alternatively, you can use the install-all script to install both the server and client dependencies in one go:

> npm run install-all

This command will install the required dependencies for both the server and client applications.

## Development
To start the development environment, you can use the following command:

> npm run dev

This command will start the server and client applications concurrently, enabling you to work on both components simultaneously.

## Deployment
To deploy the project, you can use the following command:

> npm run deploy

This command will build the client application and start the server in production mode. It prepares the project for deployment to a production environment.

## Testing
To run tests for the server and client applications, you can use the following command:

> npm test

This command will run tests for both the server and client applications, allowing you to verify the functionality and integrity of the code.

## Repository
