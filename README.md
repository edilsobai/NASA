# NASA Interstellar Mission - Kepler Exoplanets

This is a full-stack project developed  for scheduling a mission launch for interstellar travel to one of the Kepler Exoplanets. The project combines a front-end application built with React and Arwes UI framework, and a back-end built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

## Features

- Mission Launch Scheduling: Users can schedule a mission launch to one of the Kepler Exoplanets by providing necessary details and selecting a destination.
- Destination Selection: The application provides a list of Kepler Exoplanets as potential destinations for interstellar travel.
- Persistent Data Storage: The application uses MongoDB as the database to store mission and user-related information.

## Technologies Used

**Front-end:**
- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Arwes: UI framework for futuristic, cyberpunk-style designs.

**Back-end:**
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- Express: Web application framework for Node.js.
- MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing mission and user-related data.
